# Welcome to NanoBrowser 🌐

_Your AI-powered web automation companion in Chrome_

NanoBrowser is an open-source browser extension that lets you automate web tasks through natural conversations with AI agents.

## 🎯 Our Mission

We believe web automation should be as simple as having a conversation. Since automation tools require significant browser access, we're building NanoBrowser completely in the open, making transparency and trust our foundation.

* 💬 **Chat Interface:** Control your automation through natural conversations in the sidebar
* 👁️ **Visual Feedback:** Watch and control your automations in real-time
* 🔒 **Privacy-First:** Your data stays in your browser
